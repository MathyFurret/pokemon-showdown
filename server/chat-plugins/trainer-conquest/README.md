Trainer Conquest
================

Trainer Conquest is a strategy game designed by PkmnKingdom. It's a fusion of the core Pokemon games 
and Pokemon Conquest. Part of the game involves battling on Pokemon Showdown, so I had the idea of 
turning it into a full chat game programmed into a PS server.

However, I overwhelmed myself with the scope of the project and became too busy / fixated on other things
to finish it. So for now I've shelved it. I have pushed the code I've written but it's not in a playable state.

You can contact PkmnKingdom#1887 or Mathy#0845 for more info, or if you're interested in finishing this.
